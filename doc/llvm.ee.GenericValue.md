## Methods

### `as_int(self)`

Return the value of this `GenericValue` instance as an unsigned integer

### `as_int_signed(self)`

Return the value of this `GenericValue` instance as a signed integer.

### `as_pointer(self)`

Return the value of this `GenericValue` instance as a pointer.
The type of the return value is `int`.

### `as_real(self, ty)`

Return the value of this `GenericValue` instance as a real number
which type is specified by `ty`. `ty` must be a [Type][] instance
of a real number type.

## Static Factory Methods

### `int(ty, intval)`

Create a `GenericValue` instance with a `int` value,
which is zero-extended if necessary.
The type of the value is specified by `ty`, which is a [Type][] instance.

### `int_signed(ty, intval)`

Create a `GenericValue` instance with a `int` value,
which is sign-extended if necessary.
The type of the value is specified by `ty`, which is a [Type][] instance.

### `pointer(ty, addr)` or `pointer(addr)`

Create a `GenericValue` instance with a `int` value,
which is representing a pointer value.

The two argument version is **deprecated**.
The old code never used `ty` anyway.
