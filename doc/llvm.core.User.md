`User`-s are values that refer to other values. The values so refered
can be retrived by the properties of `User`. This is the reverse of
the `Value.uses`. Together these can be used to traverse the use-def
chains of the SSA.

## Properties

### `operands` 
\[read-only\]

The list of operands (values, of type [llvm.core.Value][]) that this
value refers to.

### `operand_count` 
\[read-only\]

The number of operands that this value referes to. Same as
`len(uses.operands)` but faster if you just want the count.
